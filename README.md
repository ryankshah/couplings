# Couplings

A mod for Minecraft that allows coupled usage of doors, fence gates, and trapdoors

Coupled usage of doors, fence gates, and trapdoors

- Double doors (with opposing hinges) will open together when used 
- Vertically stacked fence gates will open together when used
- All trapdoors (and opposing counterparts) along their side axes will open together when used 
  - Any redstone signal above 7 (50%) will power all coupled blocks, whereas anything less will only power the immediate block 
  - Each coupled block can be individually toggled in the configuration file (./config/couplings.toml)

This mod is recommended on both the client and server for more responsive block updates
